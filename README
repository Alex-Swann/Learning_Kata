
Hi anyone reading this!

This is my first repo, getting my head around GitHub plus currently learning Ruby, so a lot to take in. This repo has been 
created as an initial archive for all my favourite completed kata and useful solutions which are personally for me to come back
and refer to if need be. It's not designed as a cheat for users of CodeWars, mainly a more sorted memory bank for myself
and to make further adjustments to existing kata to see different iterations and how to improve a piece of code.

Any comments, feel free to message me :-)
